This repository has been created in python3. It contains two codbye files- one generating the Lagrange interpolation of a function on a domain of equidistant points and another on a domain of chebysev points
the function is identified by a value of i ranging from 1 to 4 as:  
* i=1:f(x)=sin(X)
* i=2:f(x)=sin(|x|)
* i=3:f(x)=x^3/2
* i=4:f(x)=1/1+25x^2  
The rest of the details have been provided in the comments in the code
